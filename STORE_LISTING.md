## Full Description

```
Your friend says something dumb. You open Fahh. Hit Vine Boom. You're already recording their face. The clip is gold. Shared in 10 seconds.

No other soundboard lets you do this.

Fahh plays meme sounds through your speaker WHILE your camera records. The sound, the reaction, the chaos — all captured in one video. No editing. No syncing audio later. Just press and record.

🎥 HOW IT WORKS
Open the camera. Pick a meme sound. Tap the button while filming. The sound blasts live. Your friend's reaction is captured forever. Done.

🔴 THE BUTTON
A giant 3D button that actually feels real. It sinks when you press it. Haptic feedback punches your finger. The sound fires instantly. It's embarrassingly satisfying. You'll press it 47 times before you even open the camera.

🔊 12 SOUNDS INCLUDED
   Fahh · Bruh · Vine Boom · Wow
   Air Horn · Dun Dun Dunn · Oh My God
   Directed By · Romance Sax · Sudden Suspense
   Yoooo Japan · Gop Gop Gop
   New sounds added with updates.

📱 MADE FOR SHORT-FORM CONTENT
Fahh is the fastest way to make reaction content for TikTok, Instagram Reels, and YouTube Shorts. Sound + Camera + Share. Three taps from moment to post.

Every soundboard app lets you press buttons alone in your room. Fahh puts the sound into the video, into the moment, and into your friends' nightmares.

Press the button. Record the chaos.
